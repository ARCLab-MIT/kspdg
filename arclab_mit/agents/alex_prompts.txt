ASSISTANT: The x coordinate of prograde is positive, indicating that pursuer is moving to the right. The y coordinate
of the prograde is negative, indicating that evader is approaching. The z coordinate of prograde is negative,
indicating that pursuer is moving down. To capture the evader, we should move in the opposite direction in the x axis,

ASSISTANT: Relative position is 1182.64[m] and relative velocity is 40.58[m/s]. This means that the intercept time is 29.15[s]. At -1[m/s/s] the vessel can be stopped in 40.58[s] which is much greater than, greater than or close to intercept time. Thus we decelerate.

ASSISTANT: Relative position is 306.41[m] and relative velocity is 15.35[m/s]. This means that the intercept time is 19.94[s]. At -1[m/s/s], the vessel can be stopped in 15.35[s], which is less than the intercept time. Since the relative position is less than 1000[m] we decelerate.

ASSISTANT: Relative position in magnitude is 2657.45[m] and relative velocity in magnitude is 0.48[m/s] so intercept time is estimated as 5547.37[s]. At -1[m/s/s] the vessel can be stopped in 0.48[s] which is much lower than intercept time. Thus we accelerate.
