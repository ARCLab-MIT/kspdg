# Sun-Blocking Group 1 Environments

A collection of 1-v-1 pursuit-evasion environments where the objective is to arive a co-linear point between the evader and the sun.

For reference, see: O. Jansson, M. Harris, and D. Geller, “A parallelizable reachable set method for pursuit-evasion games using interior-point methods,” in 2021 IEEE Aerospace Con- ference (50100). IEEE, 2021, pp. 1–9.

Note: These environments are actually direct extensions of the pursuit-evasion group 1 envrionemnts (pe1) with a modified objective and observations. See `pe1/README.md` for additional information on nomenclature
